## Introduction
* Agriculture plays a vital role in Bangladesh’s economy, contributing 11.5% to the GDP. Fruits comprise 10% of national income.
* Bangladesh ranks 7th in mango production globally and it is known as the king of fruits.
* Bangladesh’s annual mango production is around 1.2 million metric tons from over 100,000 acres of land.
* However, despite its potential, mango production in the country faces challenges, including pest attacks and diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and insects.
* These diseases lead to a substantial annual yield loss of around 30%, impacting farmers’ livelihoods and national production.

## Problem Statement
* Bacterial and fungal diseases are major constraints for mango production, causing around 30% yield loss annually.
* The absence of real-time, automated systems for early detection and classification of mango leaf diseases hampers efforts to mitigate crop losses.
* Currently, farmers face delayed diagnoses which reduces productivity and causes financial losses.
* This project aims to address this problem by developing a cutting-edge computer vision-based model that provides instant in-field detection and classification of mango leaf diseases, empowering farmers with timely information to reduce losses and enhance their income

## Project Goals
* The project goals are:
    * Collect a comprehensive dataset of mango leaf images encompassing multiple bacterial and fungal diseases, ensuring representation across various regions.
    * Train and optimize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to accurately detect and classify mango leaf diseases using the collected dataset.
    * Develop an intuitive user interface with trained models for real-time mango disease screening by farmers.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Have a Look at the [project structure](#project-structure) and [folder overview](#folder-overview) below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
